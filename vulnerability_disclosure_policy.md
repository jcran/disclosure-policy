# Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

[TODO: ORGANIZATION NAME] Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

As a provider of [TODO] products and services, we take vulnerability reports very seriously and recognize the importance of our users' privacy and security.  

## How To Disclose A Vulnerability

If you have a vulnerability to report, please submit it here: [TODO: SUBMISSION URI]. The report should include a detailed description of your discovery with clear, concise reproducible steps and/or a working proof-of-concept. If you do not explain the vulnerability in detail, there may be delays in our response.

We will process each report, updating it with significant events, including when the vulnerability has been validated or when more information is needed from you.

We request that you keep all communication regarding the vulnerability confidential.

## [OPTIONAL] Monetary Rewards

We offer monetary rewards for vulnerability disclosure. The amount of each bounty payment will be determined by our team, and all decisions are final. Bounty payments are subject to the following eligibility requirements:
 - Must not be based in a country in which the United States has trade restrictions or export sanctions as determined by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).
 - Minors are welcome to participate in the program. However, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act restricts our ability to collect personal information from children under 13, so you will need to claim your bounties through your parent or legal guardian if you are 12 or younger.
 - All payments will be made in U.S. dollars (USD) and will comply with local laws, regulations and ethics rules. You are responsible for the tax consequences of any bounty you receive, as determined by the laws of your country.
 - It is your sole responsibility to comply with all local laws and regulations that would affect your eligibility to participate in this program.

## Changes to These Guidelines

We may revise these guidelines from time to time. The most current version of the guidelines will always be at [TODO: POLICY URI].
